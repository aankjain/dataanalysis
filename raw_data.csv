7830092,10/22/2012,Anonymous,"These shoes are very nice. Admittedly, they are a bit scary, given the thin heel and platform, but I found them stable and comfortable (for heels). I had no issues all day at work on the first wear, aside from a little bit of rubbing on the left side (but I have bony feet, so it might just hit me oddly). I did have some discomfort (achy toebox) after a long wedding, but I think that was mostly tired feet from dancing on an unforgiving floor. ;)",NULL,"from Cleveland, OH"

7907550,4/27/2012,Anonymous,"I'm in love with this bag. I have it in the dark sand (print as shown) & everyone, including men, want to touch it & when I first saw my friends there was a quiet ""ooohhh"" that came over the group. Definitely stood out but in a good way. Very classy & the pockets are unbelievable! Great way to keep things in order but you can carry a ton in this thing. I hate to trade it out to wear other purses & I can wear it all year long. I definitely recommend this purse!",1,from just outside of Chicago
7439207,4/29/2012,Anonymous,I love these shoes. The MK is subtle and blends in nicely with the shoe. They're very comfortable and true to size. Worth every penny.,1,from New York

7748194,7/22/2011,Mina C,"These are very cute nude peep toes. However, there are several things worth noting: I am normally a size 7 and got these in 7. My heels kept slipping out of the shoes as I walked in them. I could not wear them until I put in heel inserts (these are sticky inserts you put in the back part of your heel to add a layer). I am not sure if the shoe is half size larger than marked, because the rest of the shoe fits as it should - I would not necessarily order a half size down. The opening in the peep toe is a bit large - after a few hours of wearing, my toes (where the nail meets the skin) started hurting, especially around the big toe. I have other peep toes with smaller openings which do not have this problem. The heel is quite high, which I love, but is not ideal for walking more than a few minutes.",3,"from Los Angeles, CA"

7971475,9/2/2012,Anonymous,"A bit of platform would definitely help with the steepness of the heel. I was also pretty disappointed in the suede color. It is certainly not crimson.

My size (1x) was out of stock at the time I ordered, so I went with the 2x. The larger size seems to make it more versatile to drape.

If you're worried about the size do what I did and get everything you want to put in the bag and measure it! Then get the dimensions of the bag in the ""item information"" tab to the left and see if your items will fit.

8068036,11/1/2012,Miss B,"This is a lovely coat. I'm 5""2, 125 lbs and normally wear an XS / 0 or 2. I've never tried Michael Kors or Michael before so I went by the size charts...sort of. Usually size charts are a bit off so I got the 4P just to be on the safe side, or so I thought. It's too tight! I need to get a 6P. The coat is a lovely color Orange Spice, but for some reason in person the gold toggles just sort of make it look cheap. I love the huge fur collar muff thing but it's so big it makes the coat feel too trendy. It's like I have a faux raccoon wrapped around my neck. I'm not as excited about this in person as I was about it online so I think it must go back. I'll wait for it to go on sale and if I still like it I will purchase it then.",NULL,from Boston

They didn't have a bigger size, so I JUST ordered an 8 off Zappos (they were out of 7.5). I think these are the sickest looking shoes and MK's are always pretty comfortable. I'm hoping the 8 fits.

My checkbook sized wallet did fit, however it had to be put in sideways and barely left any room for anything else. I am giving this bag overall and style ratings of four stars because it is very well made, I like that the top zips closed for added security, and the nylon is quality and would easily wipe clean. The long crossbody strap is wide enough for ease of wear. As usual, Zappos quick shipping and customer service were stellar.

The reason for the 3 stars overall is that after just a few uses, I noticed that the parts of the straw bag looked warn and sort of looked ""pilled"" like what happens to sweaters sometime. I also removed the giant ""MK"" tag. So I do like the bag, and use it often, but I would not pay that kind of money again (I paid full price) for something like this.",NULL,from Boston

Having said that, if they had fit, I would've kept them, for lack of a better choice and they are ""Summery"", a quality for which I was looking. Quality is okay - good, but not great but not terrible either. The gold color is a little muted, which may be pleasing to some. If I was going to order a larger size to try, I think they would be comfortable and suitable for all day wear.

Only problem is that it's not made to last or everyday use I guess. 3 months into owning, the zipper started splitting. Easy fix at the shoe repair shop for $5. But then when the very thin robber pad at the bottom started wearing, it became very slippery and down I went every time I wore them! Not fun to fall every single time you wear your fave pair of heels. Went to the shoe repair again. Turns out the entire sole is cracked in half wear the ball of your foot goes. So they can't do anything. Long story short: if you're looking for an investment, these are not the shoes for you. If you're okay with that, go for it. They're great while they last.",1,NULL

I saw these bags when they first came out in a store and what you should know is that the zipper tote is the large size and the Jet Set is a smaller size. As a petite woman, I fell in love with the Jet Set as soon as I saw it. Many websites are confusing the two sizes and the prices. I cannot tell which one this is at all, so I am pretty sure Zappos has the sizes confused. I am going to rate it five stars because these are beautiful, practical bags, but I have not purchased one yet. I am just waiting to see if I can catch a sale.

7761463,12/19/2012,Carrie,"The pros of this shoe are that it is really attractive! I love the look of the dressy flat with the casual sneaker sole. I also love that it's offered in several colorful choices. However, for the price, the shoe is not very comfortable. At first I was drawn to the gray and khaki suede color choices. I finally decided to splurge on a pair. I ordered a half size up (which is what I typically do when ordering a flat with a full elastic collar) and the length was fine. However the elastic dug deeply into my heel. There was plenty of extra length in the shoe, so going up another half size wouldn't have helped. It was excruciating! I could barely keep them on my feet for five minutes around the house. So I returned them and decided to try one of the patent leather colors, because it looked as though the collar of the shoe was not as ""elastic-ish"". They were much better, and didn't dig into my heel nearly as bad as its suede counterpart. They're still not the most comfortable flat, but I really like the way they look. I just wish they weren't quite so expensive for what you get.",NULL,from United States

7971475,12/21/2012,Suzanne,"Beautiful Mary Jane with classic pump style and I love the look! PRO: I had a fitted black jersey dress with shirring down the front and a round neckline that made any necklace of any length look out of place. I really wanted to wear the dress for Christmas, but wouldn't do it without some sort of color. I thought I might be able to use a pop of color in my shoes to serve as the accessory. The crimson is nice for this and looks fabulous with the dress so I ll be able to wear it with these MKs for Christmas after all! CONs as other reviewers have noted: 1) The heel is high to have without any platform, so picking up your feet and paying attention is a must, even for experienced heel-wearers 2) The sole of the shoe is without padding so plan to add some killer cushionz or similar shoe pad for the ball of your feet. And : 3) The crimson isn t fire engine red or candy apple as I was hoping, but a dark red. Bottom line- the color is close enough to work for me with the black dress and black sheer stockings with a bit of gold shimmer, the shoe inserts I got for sole cushioning work well and make the shoe comfortable on the ball of my foot, and I m willing to put up with the heel without a platform for comfort and stability on dressy winter occasions (Hello, Valentine's Day!) in exchange for this classy, pretty style. For work I wouldn't do it, but for holidays and date nights, it s worth the bother for me.

I purchased the gunmetal color, and it's a beautiful bag! I'm always nervous about buying a bag online without seeing it in person first, but I'm very pleasantly surprised. Online pictures don't do this bag justice. The leather is almost velvet soft, the texture gives the bag interesting detail, and the gunmetal color is versatile and will look great with anything. I'm so glad I decided to buy this bag and would definitely recommend it!",NULL,"from Dallas, TX"

It was really hard spending another few hours in the city and Metro with clinky sound of the heel pad nail hitting the concrete. Poor quality - too much money. But great style.

I travel a lot and find that my designer bags are so much worse for the wear because of it, so I wanted something cheap that I wouldn't be sad about having to throw away in a year. And this bag is exactly that. I really like saffiano leather because it is very durable, though it does scratch a little bit if you aren't careful. My beefs with this bag are as follows: 1. It doesn't hold its shape. After sitting on my counter it became misshapen and now there are some creases in it that won't work themselves out. 2. The straps are too short. I actually took it to a cobbler to punch new holes in the straps so that they can be worn longer.",NULL,NULL

If you are on the fence, be sure to watch the video to see them on the model feet. They fit true to size, although I have a little wiggle room towards the back of my heel and around my ankles, which is actually fine so they're not too tight if my feet get warm. The arch seems a little high to me, but I got used to it in a few hours. These are easy to walk in because all the straps keep the shoe on your foot. The foot bed, where your foot goes and walks on all day, is shiny and plasticy. I was worried about sliding around, but I don't slide at all and the shine isn't obnoxious.

The styles I like are these, beautiful trim high heel, easy to wear, flattering to the foot and well worth the price. Since I got these, they have become my favorite, they are comfortable to wear all day, and still I look great. If you have not tried higher heels girls, try these. They are leather and look great with a skirt or with a nice pair of leggings leave it to Zappos, they come through when I am looking for another high heel to wear. your shipping and packaging is great, I have been a loyal and frequent customer, who buys shoes often.

I wore them to work this Friday and got many compliments on them, I also wore them tonight on girls night out and my shoes were the envy of the crowd! My only disappointment was the actual red suede of the shoe is not as saturated as shown in the picture, they are a more subtle lightly pinkish-red (but more red than pink) suede however I still adore them; that does not make me love them any less, they are still wonderful and still a beautiful red color, I just thought the red would be more saturated.

I plan on wearing it with flat sandals, for running around town. I washed it in cold water, gentle cycle in a large mesh bag and hung it to dry. Use a warm iron to knock out the wrinkles.

It's hard not to love a boot of supple leather that encases your calf and moves with your body. The leather sole exists purely for your own comfort, as if to say ""hey, walk with me, wherever you go I will go."" I was mesmerized when these boots allowed me to add an arch insert without hesitation, as though they became an extension of my own foot. I took them off, placed them on the counter, got down on one knee and proposed marriage to them.

Worst annoyance is that the metal buckle flops as you walk and makes a constant racket. I'm glad I bought this bag on sale, which is one consolation. Another is that there is a nice assortment of internal pockets, so you can find a place for just about everything: phone, glasses, make-up, pens, keys, even a small book.",2,"from North Plainfield, NJ"

7836058,9/8/2012,Sandra,"I've been wanting this pocketbook for a year and finally purchased it since it was on sale. Some of the negative reviews: leather wasn't good, slouchy...not true. I got the tan bag with gold hardware. The leather looks, feels, and smells wonderful. It is much larger than I expected so it does ""slouch"" some when you sit it down. I would think it would need to be made of hard plastic or some other cheap material to hold its shape when you sit it down, or it would need to be completely filled. Again, it's very large. I can fit my billfold, iPhone, makeup case, eye glass holder,keys, Tylenol bottle and much more junk, with room left over for a sweater, water bottle, and iPad. I've also got the smaller, black Hamilton and find that it's tiny compared to this one. I'm glad I waited and found it on sale at Zappos and if you've ever ordered from Zappos before, you know that it arrived within a day or 2 of placing my order.

The sole is really nothing to speak of and is already showing signs of separating from the foot bed.

7971357,10/13/2012,S. S,"This is an incredibly beautiful, well made boot! I drooled over it for a couple of months before deciding I couldn't live without it. Pricey? Yes! But honestly worth it. The detail and quality are amazing and I have zero regrets with this purchase. I've worn them many times already and they have felt just fine. They are a little stiff out of the box, but soften a bit with each wear. I consistently wear a size 6 and found this boot to be true to size. I've been wearing them with a thick sock to add some cushion as there isn't much built in. I think the thicker sock helps and my foot is still comfortable in the size 6 -- not too tight. I purchased the espresso oiled vachetta and they are absolutely gorgeous. I've scuffed them a few times, but the scuffs disappear with just a few rubs with your finger. They have also gotten wet in the rain (not a down pour), but the water marks dried quickly and faded completely out. They are very versatile and look fantastic with just about anything. You can even get super skinny jeans tucked in to them if you have smallish to normal size ankles and the buckles on the boot are functional and give you some room to play with what you find comfortable. If you have been on the fence about this boot, I encourage you to go for it! I can't imagine that you will be disappointed.

I ordered the Whiskey Vintage Vaschetta, and they are a little bit of a different color than on the Zappos website - more brown than red. I found the shaft to be way too big around the ankle to the point where it bagged around my ankles. Also, the boots sort of look like booties with shafts sewn onto the top. There is an actual gap in the leather where the two meet in the front, so it makes for an awkward look. If that was one piece, I may have kept the boots.",NULL,NULL

But it was not huge. So if I returned it and ordered the size small, and it was too small, I would just have to reorder the medium. But since it was Zappos, no problem. I kept the size medium and ordered the small - it was just perfect so I returned the first belt. No shipping charges is not only a money saver, it is such a convenience. And the return process is so trouble-free. I buy everything I can through Zappos.",NULL,"from Destin, Florida"

7616384,1/9/2012,Stephanie L,"My wonderful boyfriend got this bag for me for my birthday and I loved it the moment I saw it! He, a functional lad, was looking for a bag that would hold my new 13"" Macbook Air and this bag can hold that and much more. It has got a wide strap, which provides sufficient surface area to hold a great deal of weight. I also use the handles when I carry it over my forearm or in my hand. Inside you will find three large pockets, one cell phone-sized pocket, one key chain latch thingy, and one large zipper pocket on the back wall for holding your flask when you do not want it poking out while getting your bag checked entering a club. I bought the leather cleaner/conditioner and the stain repellant because I have this bag in the luggage color and I am a mess with oil stains. Now though I have treated it I still carry around a bottle of baby powder with me to treat those pesky oil stains on the go. Still, the bag, despite three stains, looks brand new. The little lock and key may appear useless, but when I traveled to Las Vegas with it for New Years it came in handy to synch everything together when the bag was really full! Last, but not least, the person at the Michael Kors store made it a point to mention that this is Michael Kors' own favorite bag. I already had it, mind you, so he was not trying to sell it to me. I was actually looking for a matching wallet, which shows you how much I love this bag!",3,"from New York, NY 10016"

My feet are on the wide side, and this shoe was comfortable, and did not squish my toes. The description says it has a platform, however, it is very small, and the shoe doesn't have that clunky look many current platforms have this season.

7592128,1/23/2010,Anonymous,"I love the way they look--I had been looking for a pair of black patent leather round toe pumps just like them. And the price was great. The only downside is that they were horribly uncomfortable the first time I wore them. Maybe they just need to break in, but they have no padding (just you against the hard sole) and the toe is so hard that my toes were all blistered, even though I was wearing tights. But I am willing to take the pain for how good they look, only for short periods.",1,NULL

I bought the grey pair and wear them almost every single day, and I have yet to find an outfit they don't match. The are very comfortable, and super cute. My only issue with these shoes is the elastic that goes around the perimeter of the shoe which holds it onto your foot. Maybe it's just the pair that I have, but I find it way too tight and digs into my heel. These shoes don't rub and haven't caused blisters, but the tight elastic band constantly pressing tight against my heel is somewhat painful and causing a callus. Other than that one issue, these shoes are fantastic.",NULL,"from Boston, MA"
7646267,7/23/2010,Anonymous,"5 years. Took me years to find a bag that was not a suitcase, not a makeup bag, had silver hardware, and was of good quality leather. I love this bag! I don't general carry a purse but I will on vacation to schlep around the camera, wallet, snacks, etc. I get so many compliments on this purse. I am getting the black one for Fall/Winter. I was in the store and saw this bag in the large version and kept thinking, if only it were a little shorter. Then I saw the small version, if only it were a bit bigger. And voila. On sale. Free overnight shipping. I think I just had the best summer ever. There are plenty of pockets and room for a wallet, makeup bag, cell phone, keys, receipts, snacks, anything else you might stuff into your purse. I have not found anything wrong with this purse. I adore the silver. The strap is not removable but like the other reviewer said, it sits under the purse nicely. Also the length is perfect on me; I am 5'8. Buy now!",2,"from Houston, Tx"

7971357,11/27/2012,Anonymous,"If you're considering Frye boots in a short style but are concerned about the break in period or poor fit because of high arches or insoles, try these boots! They fit normal to normal/wide feet and are perfect for a high instep. I wasn't able to fit my feet in Frye boots that weren't too big with my instep, but these fit great with no slipping in the heel. The leather is a bit glossy, as shown in the picture, and very soft, although the boot overall has a structured feel -- these will hold up! The quality is fantastic. They're lined completely in a softer leather than the outer leather and nicely padded. The heel height is a little higher than it looks, a bit over an inch. I wondered if the padding would be inadequate because of an earlier review, but I found them to be very comfortable (and I have ridiculously sensitive feet, so this means comfortable!). Be aware, though, that the soles are leather -- comfortable, but potentially slippery and they'll need replacing fairly quickly if you wear them in the rain. So not the best for a wet fall or winter. I ended up deciding on a pair of La Canadienne -- a more boring style, but much better suited for what I'll need the next few months. If I could keep a second pair, though, these would be it!",NULL,from Chicago

8067311,6/2/2013,Anonymous,"Ive been carrying this bag for a couple of months, and I absolutely love it I debated colors, but I went with black because black is always my go to bag color, and this is a yearround bag for sure It holds everything, including my MacBook Air, my gigantic wallet, sunglasses case, cosmetic bag and all sorts of other stuff The Saffiano leather is brilliant because it doesnt slouch or scratch easily Yay The gold hardware is very sophisticated, so even in jeans and a tshirt, this bag takes your look up a few notches Of course, no bag is perfect, and I have two cons but they are minor 1 Shoulder strap does not remove 2 The lining on the black bag is also black, so I affectionately refer to this as the black hole Overall, this bag will get so much mileage from me I really do love it and feel so spoiled every day that I carry it Tons of compliments",NULL,from Florida

I kept them anyway because they weren't so uncomfortable that I couldn't stand it. After a few months of very normal wear, they cracked in 3 places.

My only issue with the bag is that I was hoping to use it as a tote, so that I could put in my usual purse stuff plus my iPad, an umbrella, and a pad of paper or a couple of files. But the height measurement does not take into account the fact that the zipper is recessed, so while I can stick a small umbrella into the side pocket (which I love) and fit all my purse stuff and iPad into it, I can't zip the bag if I also put in a file or pad of paper.

And while I'll agree with the other reviewers that maybe it could've been lined, I will say, I am very happy with this purchase! I'm 5' tall (on a good day!) and big busted - and have the hardest time finding dresses that fit. This dress was the 14th one I've ordered (and all the rest have been returned!), so I can't say how happy I was when it arrived, and fit! For me, the length is perfect - it sits just above my knees, but could go higher or lower (looks cute at tea length!), thanks to the stretch in the fabric. It also has beautiful draping in all the right places - if you're at all a little thicker in the waist, the twist / knot detail is a great concealer in the mid-section. I do recommend wearing some type of body shaper underneath, just because the fabric can be a little clingy - but if only to help smooth out everything.

It's a really great color and texture. I've lengthened the straps to their full extent, and they could be an inch longer, but it's not a big deal.

Her and her friends instantly fell in love with the boots. As soon as she put them on she never wanted to take them off. She did say the fit was a bit narrow compared to others but, not uncomfortable. I would caution when ordering this boot as they tend to run a size smaller than traditional boots. She normally wears a 9 but a 10 fit her perfectly. Also, I saw concerns regarding the calf size? Her calfs were just a smidge under 15"" and these boots did not give her any trouble.

I wear them to work all the time and the leather has a slight 'crinkle' effect to it so it doesn't look like that cheap, plastic patent leather. I had trouble with the insole coming out at the front end near my toes for some reason but I think that might just be because I have unusually long toes. There is definitely some padding under the insole, but it has somewhat been 'pressed down' over time and I guess it's become less effective now. My feet start to hurt after a couple hours of walking around in them but if you have a desk job and don't need to do much walking - these are perfect!

The leather is butter-soft... it's like being allowed to wear your slippers all day outside the house, and you're actually stylish :)The leather stretches quite a bit - do not be dismayed if it's snug around the toebox at first. You can pay a shoe repair place $5-7 to stretch them for you, or throw on a pair of thick socks and wear them around the house for a couple hours (or ice stretch them), and you will live in them. The first pair I bought I got in an 8 - but they stretched so much they fall off. 7.5 is perfect once it stretches.If you have very wide feet, as I do, you may find that with repeated wear, due to the type of sole the leather on the sides of the shoes may stretch out and scrape on the ground, but I've literally had pairs of these for more than two years, wore them traveling, wore them even through the famous Tokyo fish market in puddles of water - and they simply will not give up.Fantastic shoe!

While initially impressed with the way this boot fit and looked, I soon regretted having spent so much money on something that tore after a few months wear. For the price, you'd think they would have lasted for many years, but they began to rip open at the seams. Gel inserts helped out with the comfort level.

At five three the ankle length is closer to full length on me - can wear them with flats without hemming and they still look okay with a small heel. Fair warning: the rise was a little higher than I expected - at my height they basically come up to my natural waist/cover my navel. That said, the fit is slim/modern enough elsewhere that they don't look too mom-ish, even with the higher rise. For sizing, I am between an 8 and a 10 and took the larger size here, though I could have gone either way; these pants have some serious give to them. One style point off for the slightly too high rise, but these are a great go-to pant, especially for those of us between petite and regular lengths.",NULL,from New York

The face is big and bold, and watch is an attention getter for sure. I really like the way MK blended black, silver, and white to create this masterpiece. My suits look better when this watch slips out of the cuff, and it reeks of confidence and professionalism. The band is similar in design to the Rolex presidential, just a bit larger. This watch would be perfect if the second hand lined up on the markers, my biggest gripe with MK. If you find an MK you really like, and the second hand lines up, better buy it.

Without laptop, this luggage color bag is not too floppy as I would have imagined. It is spacious, but not sluggish. I could easily go from office to my dinner date by leaving my laptop somewhere else. The leather is something you will never regret spending money on, as it is so supple and durable. I highly recommend this bag for office ladies. Now I am eyeing the peanut color, thinking of buying for my sister. This is a great bag!

As you walk, there is no ""give"" in the shoe and the strap that goes around the top of the foot puts a ""strain"" on your foot, like you are trying to lift a cement block. To me, that would have been very uncomfortable after a while. The shoe is BEAUTIFUL. It has a subtle MK logo on the wedge. Not too showy, just adds a bit of style.

My only gripe is the strap is too long, even at its shortest setting. Because the bag is so structured and fairly thick at the bottom, it ends up adding bulk to the widest part of my hips. If it were just a tinge shorter, it would hit at my hip bone, instead of the middle of my butt. I am 5'4"" and own a couple other crossbody bags, including the Kors Jet Set small crossbody bag, and have no issues with the length of those.

8031250,11/23/2012,Bec215,"This shoe is GORGEOUS! It looks in person nearly identical to this photo. This shoe in Camel looks great with skinny jeans and a chunky knit brown/camel/white sweater, or with a pair of slim brown/camel pants and a blouse. I am a 6.5W (D-width) with a high instep and normal arch. Let's face it - you don't buy a shoe like this primarily for comfort. A few things to know: this is the flattest flat I've ever put on - it's almost like walking on the ground, similar to a Bloch ballet flat, but less (!) padding - the leather is very high quality but very thin compared, for example, to the Fulton Moc... this is intentional, giving the shoe a dressier appearance, but just don't be surprised - the zip detail is substantial and high quality Style-wise, the gold toe cap is a great way to incorporate the current metallic look for someone (like me, for example) who feels a full-metallic shoe is just 'too much' going on, and the zip detail across the toe cap is a great way to make a classic shoe more current, no matter your age. However... this is not the shoe to pick for long walks in the city. The shoe tends to cut across the top of the big toe in an uncomfortable way - even the girls in the MK store admit this is a problem for them, though they assured me up and down it stretches quickly and is not an issue. This may be true for people with a non-wide foot, I don't know... I have worn the shoe three times for an extended period, and it still cuts into the top of my left toe, so not sure how much more stretching will happen. I don't need a lot of support, but these are Ugg-flat, meaning if you have any arch pain issues you'll need an arch insert in these for sure. On the other hand, people with flat feet will be jumping for joy :) The Fulton Moc by Michael Kors is an immensely comfortable flat, and I have 4 pairs. These... these are not UN-comfortable, but they 'makes' an outfit and it makes me happy every time I put them on, and they're the perfect ""update"" piece to add to your wardrobe.",NULL,from Northern Virginia

7646312,5/3/2010,Banana A,"I bought both of these, the black and blush. They're so different and both so beautiful. I love the black version because it's very chic and edgy at the same time. The blush is beautiful because it works wonderfully as a neutral daytime spring/summer bag. The blush is actually a little paler which makes it work well with almost any color. The shape is what i love the most. It slouches perfectly and hangs comfortably over your shoulder. I love that the MK isn't all over it. The emblem is only on one side so you can keep it behind you or in front. Both colors go great from day to night!",1,from Southern California

The chevron panels gives the coat a sleeker, smoother look and prevent the marshmallow effect that sometimes happens with puffer coats.

8031250,11/14/2012,Anonymous,"The perfect go-to shoe to add a little flair to your outfit and a bounce to your step. I've received many compliments on them (the black version). Re sizing, if you're truly between sizes, you might wish to go a size up. It's not so much that they run small as that the rounded toe (part of what makes them so flattering) doesn't give extra toe space to the length. I've got medium width feet, and ordered my regular size. They fit me just fine (and comfortably), but my big toe does come right to the end of the shoe. Not a problem for me, and if I'd ordered a half size up they'd have been too loose at the heel and probably all over. Another reviewer mentioned that the sides felt as if they'd 'give' over time and scrape the ground. Having worn mine for a couple of months, I've seen absolutely nothing like that; the shoe has the same smart shape it did when I bought it. Since they're such good-looking shoes, you might want to take advantage of Zappos' famously easy return policy and order the shoe in two sizes to find the one that's best for you.",NULL,from Connecticut

8031269,10/4/2012,Cathy,"When first saw these boots in MK Fall catalog...went nuts! As I always order from Zappos when available, and these did not disappoint. I ordered the all black, but the black/mocha combo is stunning (saw them in a store). The leather is beautiful, high gloss fullgrain leather with a slim, tall-to-knee fit and snug profile (not slouchy at ankle or below knee). The true rounded toe, 1"" heel and very slight platform sole define it as classy riding boot. The MK logo harness decoration is bold and classic. They look fabulous with skirts and under bootcut jeans or with skinny jeans tucked in. I am 5'9"" with 14"" calves. Beware that may not fit on 15"" or larger calves...so may need to try them if you have larger calves. These are much better quality leather and updated profile than MK last year's Hamilton boot. Thanks Zappos for next day delivery (I am so lucky to live in KY)! I'm a fan for life!",NULL,"from Lexington, KY"

They are so comfortable and don't cause skin tears like other types can. My daughter who is 8.5 does not like to wear socks with her mary janes and other leather or patent shoes would always cause welts and problems. These are extremely comfortable and don't slip off when she walks. She's a very active girl with slim feet and very fashion conscious so the details and pattern as well as the fit and comfort on this shoe were really big hits with her. Just be aware these shoes are made of a thick quality fabric and do wear out after 4-5 months esp. if your kids are active. We finally threw the last pair out after 5 months as the toe area was developing holes and tears. My daughter still loved it though, wears and tears and all. Didn't want to part with it until I found this pair on Zappos. Received it in 2 days flat. Love Zappos quick delivery and easy returns.

The leather wasn t too hard but unfortunately I had to return them because I know they would have started hurting my feet due to the lack of cushion in the shoe bed and no flexibility while walking, as with all these types of platform shoes. If you like platform wedge shoes and you know what to expect then these are for you. You won t be disappointed with the workmanship of these shoes. They are Gorgeous!! It s just that these were not for my feet. I'm usually an 8.5 and got them in a 9 instead, and they fit well.

I wear 7.5 in all shoe types, but these were just slipping at the heel so much, I couldn't even walk. I was considering buying a size 7, but it fits perfectly in the front and given the hight of the heels, the 7 would probably be too tight. Also, the boots are really tall. I'm 5'5"" and these hit a litte above where my knee starts, covering part of it, making it look like rain boots. The shaft opening is too wide for me, buy about a full inch. If the shaft was shorter, that width wouldn't matter, my claves would fill it out. The leather is super soft, so it's easy to pull on and off. It's so soft that I was able to bend it down an inch, which gave me the perfect shaft hight and circumference.

8031551,11/14/2012,Ppn12,"Love! I was a little concerned about the height on these, but wore them for the first time today...a solid 8 hours and they felt pretty good overall, and got lots of compliments on them, but was still happy to take them off when i got home. My only complaint was that it felt tight at the ankle where it bags, which made it uncomfortable after a while, but that's to be expected because my pants were also tucked in. It's leather though so you know it will stretch, therefore I still gave a 5 for comfort. I have a wide foot and the width was great...a true 8. The boot goes quite high up the leg so when I bend at the knee, the boot comes right to the crease of the knee. I can deal, but that may be important for someone to know. The color is awesome, I first got the black and exchanged for the brown because I found the color enhanced the look of the boot more. I will say the Zappos team was great with the exchange, I got the brown ones within 2 days from the day I exchanged. If I had the cash though, I'd buy them in every color! I'm very happy with these boots...great dressed up or down, and sexy too!",NULL,"from vancouver, bc"

The jacket in 14 P fit perfectly in the shoulders and sleeve length but was too tight to close the toggles on the hip. I normally wear a 16P or 14WP. The toggles are stiff and difficult to close. If you have arthritic fingers it may not be a good choice for you. After lengthy debate, I decided to keep the jacket and wear it with a brown cashmere sweater without closing the toggles. It will be fine for a cool fall day. The quality of the fabric and tailoring is nice . Like another reviewer, I felt like the faux fur collar was too bulky for someone short. My daughter is fairly tall with a long neck so she will keep the collar for herself. I hope she bought the jacket on sale. I would not have paid full price for this jacket but the sale price is acceptable.

I remember trying on one style of Kors at Nordstrom because I liked the baby-doll style. None fit me no matter what size I tried. I bought these and the sizing is again off. One shoe way too big that I couldn't keep it on, the other slipping on the left heel. Therefore, I've decided to never buy a Kors unless I'm face to face with the shoe. How does this company justify the high cost when they can't seem to get sizing right? Sizing is so elemental, isn't it? A pair of their cargo pants had the same problem. Kors needs a shake-up in their organization and someone setting down the standards and insisting that China produce it. Kors doesn't deserve the mark-up at all.

7902822,7/19/2012,Anonymous,"Comfort: This shoe is made of soft, supple leather, and it feels very form-fitting when you put them on. They take the shape of your feet, and are very comfortable and cute. Step: They are really quiet shoes, so you won't be drawing undue attention when walking through a quiet hallway. Style: These shoes are very stylish and cute. They have an interesting texture, so they are neither particularly glossy nor matte - they are somewhere in the middle. These shoes are versatile: they are easy to dress down with pants, or dress up with a dress and tights. Size: I am normally a size 5.5 or 6. I actually initially bought these in a size 6, and I thought these fit. I wore them a lot for 2.5 months, before they started to ""wear in"" to the point that my feet were starting to slip around in the shoe, falling off the edge of the sole, adding an uncomfortable hiccup in my walking. I then bought a size 5.5, which fit great! I don't feel like my feet are going to slip off the sole, but at the same time, they don't feel too snug.",NULL,"from Boston, MA"

The picture does not do this skirt justice! It is of excellent quality (Michael Kors tends to be in my experience) and the fit is very flattering.( I am glad that I listen to other reviews and ordered 1 size up. I am a size 4 but tall and ordered the 6. It fits well.) I would say that I am a somewhat trendy dresser but I don't like to do overkill with that kind of stuff. Basically the safari style is in this season but I wanted something that could show the more modest side of that trend but stand the test of time and remain a classic part of my wardrobe.

7907420,12/6/2011,Anonymous,"I have been looking for an MMK convertible bag and owning many Kors bags, I ordered this but had to return it. The bag is an overall good size and the quality and leather is excellent. However, the shoulder/crossbody straps do not sit comfortably due to the squared-off design of the clasps and where they sit on the side of the bag, at an angle and not flush with the bag when attached. There are also snaps on each side and when the longer strap was connected, the snaps would release and it would cause an abrupt shift in the weight of the bag when worn over the shoulder or crossbody. I was totally surprised when these gave away and could feel the strain on my shoulder as the bag's weight shifted. This bag should be exactly what I want for the price, but this one fell short. Thanks to Zappos return policy, I will keep looking for that convertible Kors bag that will work for me.",1,from Pennsylvania

They were definitely too big. Not too big to live with, possibly, but if I had been in a store setting, I would have gotten a smaller size. 2) The quality of the boots was really disappointing. They don't seem to be constructed very well. The top of the sole (the area that shows around the edge when you look down at your feet) is missing paint/coloring, there is at least one section where the leather seems to have a silver patch at the seam? The nylon stretch material seems to have ""slubs"" or maybe glue bits on it. The boots in general seemed poor quality for the price and the Michael-Michael Kors name.

8066197,11/29/2012,Anonymous,"I purchased this bag at a department store in black. I really like the weightlessness of this bag and the front slip and zip pockets. The strap is easily adjusted and plenty long enough to wear comfortably as a crossbody. The inside lining is also black, making it difficult to see/find items I have in the bag. When my iPad is in the bag, I do not have much room in the bag for anything else except keys and cell phone. My iPad has a very thin cover and is still a tight fit in the bag, with the top zipper tough to close when iPad is in it. I like that the MK branding is not flashy or gaudy, but tastefully done. The patent trimming is a nice touch, overall a very nice bag.",NULL,from Illinois

I don't think it comes in extra large. My favorite part is wearing White linen pants and feeling comfortable without a full coverup. A friend thought the top was the coverup for the swimsuit.

7581576,4/17/2012,Kerrie,"I had my eye on this watch for a while...everyone is sporting the all gold one but i prefer the silver and gold as it is more wearable with different jewelry. Style wise it is definitely on trend and although its large its fairly comfortable. I love that it has the date feature and one thing that wasn't mentioned was that the hands glow in the dark which is a cool feature. One thing I know I'm going to have a problem with is how the watch is going to wear...I can already tell that the 'golden' color thats painted on will rub off with a lot of wear. A couple of the links show wear and I've only had the watch for 2 months and I am careful with it...so the quality isn't there. Then again, I don't think this watch is 'made to last'...it's trendy and pretty but that's about it. For some, spending money for a watch is a lot and if the expectation is there that this is a watch that they will be able to wear for years to come, don't get this. Get a classic brand such as Seiko that'll last forever and that's in the same price range.",NULL,"from Albany, NY"

It arrived just as cute as in the photo, but after wearing it 4 or 5 times, the finish on the leather strands has begun to peel off and fall off everywhere. It now looks so ugly, and I leave trails of leather finish pieces wherever I go. There are flakes of the finish handing off. I definitely expected much better from this belt, and I honestly feel like it was a total waste of money. It was wearable only 2 or 3 times.

7824542,12/30/2011,Constance H,"I absolutely love the look of these shoes (I got mine in python)and appreciate the not too high heel. They are good quality, a sophisticated style, and go well with many looks. However, it's been a struggle to make them work: I ordered them in my usual size, 8.5 but they slipped right off my heel so I exchanged them for an 8 (great customer service, btw) which made almost no difference in the heel but made my toes feel more pinched. I had to add four inserts per shoe to make them stay on (I know...that's silly) but now my toes look like they're trying to escape out the peep hole. The whole thing seems very Lucille Ball-esque. Oh well, I kept them and I still think they're chic and beautiful so I will soldier on.",2,"from Boulder, CO"
7591941,5/21/2011,Anonymous,"This is such a beautiful shoe! I was very impressed when I took it out of the box. At first I thought the patent leather would be a bit much...too shiny and all that...but it's actually very nice looking! For a 3"" heel I think it's very comfortable to stand in and feels sturdy. It has some padding although I do think I would buy an insert to get some additional padding to provide my feet with extra comfort. I haven't worn them outside yet and have only walked in them on carpet in my home to make sure they feel comfortable on my feet but I do look forward to wearing them outside. I usually wear a 6.5 and that's the size I bought these in. My heels slip out of the shoe when I walk in them but that may be because I didn't have stockings on. I don't think going down a half size would be a wise decision. All in all, a beautiful shoe that I believe is true to size. So far, comfortable but I guess the true test is when I wear them outside.",1,"from New York, NY"

8031250,10/3/2012,Bec215,"I'm normally a 6.5W, but in MK flats I take a 7.5 very consistently. The MK Fulton flats are my go-to, and the flat by which I generally measure comfort as they feel like wearing slippers. These are not like Fultons. They have zero padding, and zero support. The leather is very thin compared to the more substantial Fulton leather. Additionally, the edge of the front of a shoe cuts into the joint bone of my big toe - something the staff in the MK store admitted it did to them too ""for just the first day, until they stretched."" In other words, the shoe cuts into the bone of your big toe, whether you are narrow or wide footed, high arch or low, super-thin or not. There are ways to stretch the depth of the toe box on leather shoes, but just do not be surprised. You won't feel it as much standing, but when you walk at a normal pace you'll feel it. Additionally, with my wide feet, just standing and walking in the store for 10 minutes, I could tell the side of the shoe was going to scuff on the floor after a few wearings, because there's not enough structure in most ballet flats to stop that stretching and buckling. The Fulton's do this too, but not badly - partly due to having more of a pronounced sole. These have what looks like 1/8"" heel, so nearly right on the ground. The problem is, this is one of the most beautiful shoes I've seen all season! It literally makes an outfit. I put them on in the store with jeans and a sweater,and felt instantly polished. They would be appropriate for work, travel, and casual wear - and they have the metallic toe cap that is in all the Fall lines, but without the high-maintenance issues presented by actual metal toecaps seen on more trendy shoes. I am in love with them. And I bought them. We'll see what happens as I wear them around the house more - I may have to return them if they don't stretch more. So my advice is, grab a pair of full-length padded shoe inserts, and enjoy these incredibly stylish, beautiful, classy and classic flats for what they are.",NULL,"from Alexandria, VA"

Anyway, I put these on as soon as I received them. Immediately, I noticed something was off about the fit. They definitely run big in length, but the oddest thing is the width ratios. These shoes run wide at the widest part of your foot and too narrow in the toe box...try to imagine that the front of the shoe is very narrow, but the part after the toe box just lets out and doesn't hug your foot at all along the size. The result is that if you have wide feet, then it becomes very obvious and almost exaggerated. It's hard to explain, but I hope I'm giving you a good mental image. I am going to see if a smaller size works OK for me, but if not I'm sad because these are very cute!

The outside of the shoe is made from a sturdy suede. These shoes are going to be great for me at work on days when I need to get around a lot. Feeling them you can tell that they are of very nice quality and will be durable. I know that I will get a lot of use from these.

7824307,11/3/2012,Anonymous,"I agree...these do actually run 1/2 size too big. I usually never run into this, even when people say it, but with these, it is true. So I always wear a 7 1/2, but with these the 7 was better, especially if I'm going barefoot or with a thin sock. The 7 1/2 even with a thick sock, my heel was slipping too much. I'm sure they stretch a little too, as all shearling. I did contact the company, and they are fine to wear barefoot. I agree, not as thick shearling as Uggs, but better, because feet are warm, but you don't get too hot when indoors. I for one do not like classic Uggs, as they are clunky to walk in, and I feel they never cradle my foot. I've been searching for a nice streamlined fitted expensive warm boot, and finally, though expensive, these are them. I am short, and wish the shaft was at least 12 inches, a little taller, but these still are nice. I like them worn up, though the cuffed style looked cute too.

However, for the price, I would want it to fit like a glove. They don't---there is lots of space under and around the arch. The length was perfect---I could walk around in them just fine---but if I sit down and cross my legs, the shoe falls right off. It might be that I have a narrower foot than I thought.",NULL,from United States

7986149,9/17/2012,Anonymous,"I absolutely love these shoes. They are cute and stylish but also comfortable. The great thing about these shoes is the fact that part of the shoe is made with stretchy fabric. This is great for people, like me, that have wider feet. The straps are also long with Velcro so if you have a higher arch or smaller feet, you can make the strap longer or shorter as needed. They also add height, which I love because I am on the shorter side. And last but certainly not least, they are super comfortable! I absolutely love them. Thank you, Michael Kors, for making great shoes!",NULL,from New Jersey

7902822,11/8/2012,Anonymous,"I really like these shoes. I wanted casual shoes that I can wear for long hours and yet still be presentable for work. When I first wore them, my feet were killing me but after the second or third time, they were fine. Not sure if it was because I was on my feet for most of the day (work) or if they needed to be ""worn in"" since they were new. But regardless, they are comfortable now. Maybe they just needed to stretch out a little. It is made of soft leather but feels like they are strong enough to last for awhile. I'm hoping they do because they don't come cheap. The leather does crease and you'll get these ""walking"" creases on them but that is normal for any shoe. I would recommend these shoes both for long hours and even for walking around the city.",NULL,NULL

7824542,8/25/2011,Dana K,"I can't say enough good about these shoes! I bought them in black patent and in the luggage color and they are the perfect shoe! Good for work and great for play! The heel looks high, but the hidden platform make them totally walkable and I'm talking totally walkable as in, on your feet all day, and walking around a broken-concrete city with your man walking too fast kind of comfortable! Yes I'm serious! And the reason they're so comfy is because of the materials used in production. Brovo Michael Koprs! They are leather and they are lined with leather (unlike so may brands who are taking the cheap way out and line our shoes with synthetic pleather vinyl giving us blisters)! It's not that I'm bitter. These just work! And girls, I have discovered a tool that has changed my shoe-loving life! Peep-toe shoes often dig in, either around the toe opening or within the toe box. These were ever-so-slightly tight around my big toe area of my left shoe. I bought a tool called a toe box lifter (google it because they run around a decent price) I discovered it in a fancy shoe boutique while looking for shoes for my up-coming wedding. I found a shoe I loved but it pinched me badly in the toe area. The girl in the store brought out this nifty tool that goes into the toe area closed, and you squeeze it to open p within the toe area to stretch the shoe. It is not one of those old school grandpa shoe stretchers made of wood split down the middle, no! This one is for us girls! I have put back many a dream-shoe because of this problem, no more. Let me say that these shoes are super-comfy without any mild stretching with a toe box lifter, the black one's didn't need any work at all, and the luggage ones took two little stretches and they fit like a glove. Plus the leather will conform to your feet over time. I just cant emphasize it enough. These are the perfect little peep-toe shoes and they are really well-padded at the ball of your foot. Just the best. Great job M. Kors and Zappos and as always, superior service. (You had been out ",6,"from Long Island, NY"

7971394,9/8/2012,Anonymous,"All I can say is, Wow! Really? Freaking awesome shoes! Little background, I am shoe hoarder, but a very picky one, I think great shoes give you confidence and give a long, lean line to whatever you're wearing. I especially like 4""+ shoes because I am 5'6"" and tall girls are hot girls. I own numerous pairs of Christian Louboutin's, Miu Miu's etc., all beautiful shoes but no matter what there is a bit of a comfort and size issue until long time worn in (I am a true size 7.5 and wear anywhere from 7-8.5 in those brands with no guaranty of comfort). I totally agree with first chick on these shoes (and thank her for her review on which I relied to buy these), these shoes were comfortable from first time I put them on and make pretty manicured feet look sexy as hell. I work Midtown NYC, wore them to work all day and drinks with clients afterwords (a lot to ask of new shoes) and they hung in there like champ. My new go to shoes, tru dat! I bought dark tan in 7.5, perfect size and am now buying Light Sand and Black (had to buy size 8, darn it, but still not hesitating).

Also while it fits well, the top straps go 360 degrees around the foot- just below the ankle bone.

There is arch support you can actually feel -- hitting the arch in the right place. Extraordinarily good fitting shoes. My arch is very high, my heel is narrow, but the toe box on my foot is normal. Finding a brand that fits this well -- holy cow, Michael Kors will be the first shoes I look for from now on. I almost forgot to mention that these shoes look totally amazing on. I've worn them three times and have gotten compliments each time. My only criticism is that the leather around the toe hole could be a bit softer.

I love my light tan matte bag and for all looking at this bag on line you should know that it is leather. I can't find it in their description, but it feels like leather, smells like leather and wears like leather. It is a definitely a good leather bag that will last a long time. I tend to wear my expensive bags like this until they disintegrate, and then I take them to the my leather guy. This bag is leather and this is an excellent price for the bag. I got this one not on sale at Nordstroms. So if you want it and you are still unsure, run over to Nordstrom and look at it, but buy it for significantly less here. One thing -- it is a heavy bag, the leather is not light and the hardware adds to the weight. But if you've got a lot of stuff to carry like me (Busy, working mom 2 boys!), then this bag will hold everything you need, including net book, phone, iPad, wallet, keys and some kid's forgotten textbook!",NULL,"from Los Angeles, CA"

7713525,4/5/2011,Jennifer M,"I've got a love-hate thing going on here. I love these shoes. They look great on my feet and are just the right amount of heel. But, they have a heavy leather sole at the bottom which clomps when I walk. Aside from the noise, It also makes the shoe heavier than necessary. This is an issue for me, but maybe not for most people. I have tendon issues and wearing a heavy shoe seems like a great idea in the morning and a really bad idea about 2 hours later. You will definitely need to use powder to keep from getting a blister while you break them in and pack a Band Aid. And there is no room for an insole. So if you're a bit of a gimp, like me, maybe buy a size larger. Still, while I write this, I'm talking myself into keeping them.",2,from The D

They look great with any outfit and you can walk all day in these shoes, support is great. I never liked wooden heels as they are not that great for a long walk, but these shoes are so different - just so light. You just have to get half size larger or maybe even one size for someone. I usually have always 6 size, very small feet, but I had to take 6.5 and look exact fit. Once you get true size, shoes look great on any foot.

7954054,12/21/2012,Suzanne,"Admired these for a long time and got the Nude Patent in a size 7 and  after my heel had pulled out of a size 8. (Ive noticed heels over 3 inches sometimes make my foot move forward far enough in a shoe that my normal size 8 runs a little too big and allows my heel to pull out of the shoe.) Unfortunately, the 7 and  was just a bit too snug on my middle two toes, though Im sure this is due to my feet, not the shoes. I have narrow feet with a slender heel, and long toes, so I dont think most girls would have the problem I did. The shoe itself is extremely comfortable and the platform makes it very comfortable and easy to walk in. If you have a slender foot with narrow heel and average-length toes, then this shoe would probably be comfortable for you in a half size smaller than whatever size you normally wear. If your feet are a regular width then youll probably love the fit and feel of these classy and comfortable pumps. I gave 5 stars for these since its only my two unusual foot characteristics together that made it not work for me. (Attention Michael Kors- - PLEASE offer narrow widths in your most popular shoes!) I exchanged these for the Michael Kors Galli which is not as comfortable without a platform, but worked well with some cushioning insoles I added. Zappos made the exchange with grace and a sense of humor, as always. Thanks, Zappos!",NULL,"from Denver, Colorado"

The style is perfect for summer, and they go just as well with a nice dress as with some breezy linen pants, or jeans (though it hasn't been cool enough here)! As far as comfort goes, they are pretty good for the heel height. For reference, I only occasionally wear a heel higher than 2.5-3 (subtracting platforms and whatnot), and while these were slightly high for me, I never had to do the bent-knee walk. I wore them to a wedding and was standing/walking/dancing for at least 4 of the 6 hours. My quads and the balls of my feet were a little sore by the end, but the cushioned footbed and the arch were supportive enough that I didn't notice until I took them off. As mentioned in the other reviews, the straps run a little tight. I have B-width feet, but on the narrow end of the spectrum, and small ankles, so I went ahead and ordered my normal size and they were perfect.

7907481,3/9/2012,Anonymous,"I bought this bag from another retailer (Zappos didn't have the color I wanted) and it's a nice bag. Soft leather, quality hardware. Despite having the dimensions listed, it was smaller than I expected, mostly due to the small opening. The leather is soft and porous (doesn't seem super durable but we shall see). I like having the two handles, although if you wanted to remove the hand strap and only use the shoulder strap it would be a bit of a hassle. I wish the buckle holes in the shoulder strap used grommets - the holes are just punched through and unfinished. The dustbag (I know, I know) gets the biggest complaint. It seems incredibly cheap; it's made of satin (hair clings to it like you wouldn't believe) and the drawstrings are made of slippery satin cord. The knots come undone so the drawstring comes out of its casing constantly. It is only the dustbag, but it has to protect the bag bag. I know I'm nitpicking. Overall, it's a nice bag. Not sure it's worth the price tag though, you're mostly paying for the name.",1,from alaska

7986002,10/5/2012,Anonymous,"When we received these, they were very cute and stylish. My daughter loved them. After a couple of days using these hi-tops we started to see some slight fraying along the edges where the eyelets are located. We quickly found out that the large ribbon laces were not functional or as cute as it had looked in the photo. The hook eyelets were spinning around, not secured and it allowed the ribbon to slip off of the hook. We opted to not tie them all of the way up, but still found that the ribbon lace was too long and more of a hindrance than what we expected. There is no support for my daughter's feet so it is very flat. So, if you are only going to where these for fashion then go for it. If you want an everyday stylish shoe - it will be a little frustrating with laces and achy feet.",NULL,NULL
